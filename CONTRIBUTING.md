1. **Create an Issue**:
   - Before working on anything, check for open issues or create a new one to describe the bug or feature you'd like to address.

2. **Discuss Your Ideas**:
   - Join the discussion on **Gibberlink** or GitHub to align your proposed changes with the projectâ€™s goals and technical standards.

3. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Branch naming convention: Use descriptive names like `fix/bug-name` or `feature/feature-name`.
   - Follow coding best practices and adhere to the established style guidelines.

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Push your changes to your forked repository and open a PR to the main branch of the original repository.
   - Provide a clear description of the changes and reference the related issue.

5. **Collaborate and Review**:
   - Address feedback and suggestions from maintainers and other contributors.
   - Ensure all checks (e.g., tests and code linting) pass successfully.
